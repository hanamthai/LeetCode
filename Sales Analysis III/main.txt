-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
-- Idea:
-- Step 1: Get the product_id that do not meet the condition
-- (cause it will have product to sale before or after this timelines so i'll remove that exception)
-- Step 2: Get request variable in Product table that does not exsits in step 1
-- IF will have case that the product never sale before so i have to left join 2 table
WITH pro_except AS (
    SELECT p.product_id FROM Product p
    LEFT JOIN Sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
    WHERE sale_date > '2019-03-31' OR sale_date < '2019-01-01' OR s.product_id IS NULL
)

SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name FROM Product p
WHERE p.product_id NOT IN (
    SELECT * FROM pro_except
)
