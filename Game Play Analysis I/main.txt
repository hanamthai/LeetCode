solution 1:
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
with Activity_tmp as (
    select player_id, event_date,
    row_number() over(partition by player_id order by event_date asc) as row_num 
    from Activity
)

select player_id, event_date as first_login from (
    select player_id, event_date from Activity_tmp
    where Activity_tmp.row_num = 1
)

solution 2: (better way)
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login from Activity 
group by player_id
